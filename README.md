## üë©üèª‚Äçüíª Pick and Pocket üí∞

This main idea of this project is about picking short-time works posted by the requesters, that can be accomplished within a day and pocket/earn real money besides helping them finish their work sooner. Also increase the communal bond üë´ of supporting eachother either with some work to share or earn some money in their free time.

With Pick and Pocket, you will have a platform to post your work for sharing or pick up some short-time works posted by others to make some money in your free time.

## Goals of this project

The goal of this project is to build a full-stack app using new technologies not gone through during the bootcamp. Learned and used these new tools by going through documentations.

- Practice full-stack development
- Usage of what we learned in the bootcamp
- Practice learning new technology independently
- Showcase development approach of using wireframes and user stories
- Practice disciplined git usage like proper commits & branching.

## User stories & Wireframe

- User Stories

  - As a person who has work that needs to get done I should be able to login to the app and I can post requesting a service, so I can get my work done by someone
  - As a user, I would like to see a dashboard. In this dashboard, I am able to see other users‚Äô posts ao that I can see available works
  - As a person who has some work, I have my own dashboard where I can see only my posts and accept the work done by others, so that I can track the work completion.
  - As a person looking for work I want to respond to the available short time job(s) so that I can help and make some money
  - As a person looking for work I want my client to be able to pay me, so I can easily get rewarded
  - As a person looking for work I want to be able to receive a notification when a new job is posted, so that I can stay updated - Work in progress

  This mvp is still a work in progress. Some features still need to be implemented and revised. If you have any suggestions, please let me know here.
